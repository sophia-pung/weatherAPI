# weatherAPI
A week seven Techtonica project. I created a React interface that accesses a weather API to help plan my outfits for going camping. 

The API used is https://openweathermap.org/ : I used this API to get data for the city I'm camping in, and the connected the temperatures to various outfits to display on the outfit card, depending on what the weather is.
