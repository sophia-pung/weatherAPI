# weatherAPI
A week seven Techtonica project. I created a weather API with an interface the connects the API to planning my outfits for going camping. 

The API used is https://openweathermap.org/ : I used this API to get data for the city I'm camping in, and the connected the temperatures to various outfits to display on the outfit card, depending on what the weather is.
